# Buz' Userspace

Playground and shared stuff for my keyboards, mostly funny 40-60% split ortho
things.

## Layers

### QWERTY

Mostly a standard qwerty layer, but with additional LTs on Z and X to access
a `vim` (hjkl navigation) and `num` (numpad) layers.

### Lower

Missing keys on small boards.


### Raise

Missing keys on small boards.

### Adjust

Keyboard adjustments like `RESET` and RGB stuff.


### Vim

Cursor navigation and other keys.


### Mouse

Mouse emulation using `hjkl` keys.


### Numpad

### FN

Additional function keys for 60% staggered.


## Keys

Most of my layouts follow these *rules*:

* Capslock is (`CTL_T(KC_ESC)`).
* Left thumb is (`LGUI_T(KC_ENT)`).
* Access Vim layer on `Z` (`LT(_VIM, KC_Z)`).
* Access Numpad layer on `X` (`LT(_NUM, KC_X)`).
* Access Mouse layer on Tab (`LT(_MOUSE, KC_TAB)`).
* Space Cadet shift keys.


## Extras

* Some RGB actions on layer changes.
* Print layer information on OLED displays (`crkbd` and `helix`).
* Print RGB matrix information on OLED displays (`crkbd` and `helix`).
